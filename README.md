# M&A Simulation with Machine Learning

This project simulates a comprehensive Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) process using machine learning models. It leverages various machine learning techniques to perform tasks such as company valuation, target identification, due diligence, negotiation, and post-merger integration. The simulation uses synthetic data to model complex company metrics and demonstrates how machine learning can enhance decision-making in M&A activities.

# Features
Data Generation: Creates synthetic data representing various company metrics.
Due Diligence: Identifies high-risk companies based on specific criteria.
Valuation Model: Predicts company valuations using a Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning.
Target Identification Model: Classifies potential acquisition targets using a Random Forest Classifier.
Integration Success Model: Predicts the success of post-merger integrations using machine learning.
Negotiation Simulation: Calculates offer prices based on valuation and employee satisfaction.
End-to-End Simulation: Executes the entire M&A process, demonstrating how machine learning can streamline and enhance each stage.

# Upon execution, the script will:

Generate synthetic company data.
Train machine learning models for valuation, target identification, and integration success prediction.
Perform due diligence to identify high-risk companies.
Evaluate company valuations.
Identify acquisition targets.
Simulate negotiation by calculating offer prices.
Predict the success of post-merger integrations.
Display intermediate results at each step.

# Function Descriptions
1. generate_complex_company_data(num_companies=100)
Generates a pandas DataFrame containing synthetic data for a specified number of companies. The data includes various financial and operational metrics such as Revenue, EBITDA, Debt, Market Share, etc.

Parameters:

num_companies (int): Number of companies to generate data for (default is 100).
Returns:

pd.DataFrame: DataFrame containing the generated company data.
2. due_diligence(company_data)
Identifies high-risk companies based on RiskFactor and Debt metrics.

Parameters:

company_data (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing company data.
Returns:

pd.DataFrame: Subset of company_data with high-risk companies.
3. train_valuation_model(data)
Trains a Random Forest Regressor to predict company valuations using selected features. It includes hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

Parameters:

data (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing company data.
Returns:

RandomForestRegressor: Trained valuation model.
4. train_target_identification_model(data)

model (RandomForestClassifier): Trained target identification model.
Returns:

pd.DataFrame: Subset of company_data identified as targets.
8. negotiation(targets)
Calculates offer prices for identified targets based on their valuation and employee satisfaction.

Parameters:

targets (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing identified target companies.
Returns:

pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with an additional OfferPrice column.
9. post_merger_integration(targets, model)
Predicts the success of post-merger integrations for the negotiated targets using the trained integration success model.

Parameters:

targets (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing negotiated target companies.
model (RandomForestClassifier): Trained integration success model.
Returns:

pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with an additional IntegrationSuccess column.
10. simulate_m_and_a_with_ml()
